# Hermes

Module for exporting data from the simulation outside.

## Goals

- [x] - Real-time server for inputting and outputting data.
- [x] - Data storage.
- [x] - Parallel to the simulation, so preferably not on the same thread.
- [x] - Historical data API.

## Plan

1. Basic outputting of data, using API.
2. Parallelize it.
3. Real-time using sockets?
